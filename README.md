# Avocado-Prices-Prediction-using-Prophet

Welcome to the Avocado Prices Prediction project, where we leverage machine learning and time series forecasting to predict avocado prices with remarkable accuracy. This repository contains the code and resources to help you explore, understand, and implement our predictive model using the Facebook Prophet library.

## Overview

The avocado industry experiences fluctuating prices due to various factors such as seasonality, regional variations, and market trends. Our project aims to provide valuable insights and predictions to stakeholders, including growers, retailers, and enthusiasts. By forecasting avocado prices, we empower decision-makers to optimize their operations, manage inventory, and plan marketing strategies effectively.

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis**: We conduct a thorough analysis of historical avocado price data, identifying important trends and seasonality patterns.
- **Prophet Model**: We utilize Facebook Prophet, a powerful time series forecasting tool, to develop a robust predictive model.
- **Predictive Insights**: Our model not only predicts prices but also provides interpretable insights into the driving factors behind the forecasts.
